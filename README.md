## bandstructureforgpaw
This script allows you to interpolate the different bands in eigenenergies vs. k-point graphs. You must have a previous calculation with GPAW for using it.

# Instructions

Provide a .gpw file and run the program. 

$ python band_structure.py

Then, the program will ask you for the desired method of interpolation: LCAO, PAW, PW and Finite Difference.
